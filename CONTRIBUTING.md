Hello buddy!! Thanks for considering to contribute. Below are the steps you should follow.

* Add a {some name}.html file inside **notes** directory. Add code to the file in following format (you should also change background and foreground color if you want) -
```html
<body style="background-color: #1a75ff">
  <p style="color: #800000">{some thought}</p>
</body>
```

* Edit **index.html** to include your file in html code with following format - 
```html
<a href="notes/{some name}.html" target="_blank">{time} {date}</a>
```

Thanks for taking interest.
